# ECSE-223-Flexibook-Application
This is an application named Flexibook, which helps startup/new businesses to plan their schedule effectively and to communicate with their customers/users.

To successfully implement this project, our group has decided to use JAVA swings for the UI, umple, gradle, and gherkin scenarios. Our group have tried our best to cover all possible scenarios, yet, there might be some errors and scenarios that we have not yet discovered. Hence, we will continuously check and further update the file.
